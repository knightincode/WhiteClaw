# White Claw: 3D-Printed Robotic Arm With Claw

White Claw is a hardware-software integration project featuring a 3D-printed robotic arm capable of precision movement across six degrees of freedom. The system serves as a functional demonstration of bridging high-level web interfaces with low-level embedded systems to achieve real-time physical actuation.

The project utilizes a custom microcontroller setup to translate serial inputs from a web application into fluid mechanical motion. By mapping numerical commands to specific joint indices, the system allows for intuitive remote operation of the hardware.
